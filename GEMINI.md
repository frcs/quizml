## Building and running

Before submitting any changes, it is crucial to validate them by running the
full preflight check. 
To run the full suite of checks, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest .
```
## Python version

Do not use the default `python` or `python3` when invoking python as I use
macports, specifically /opt/local/bin/python3.9

## Git Repo

The main branch for this project is called "main"

## Comments policy

Only write high-value comments if at all. Avoid talking to the user through
comments.

## General requirements

- If there is something you do not understand or is ambiguous, seek confirmation
  or clarification from the user before making changes based on assumptions.
